following order:\n *\n * `[R, S, C]`\n *\n * To help illustrate the example, assume `S` is `SimpleEventPlugin` (for\n * `onClick` etc) and `R` is `ResponderEventPlugin`.\n *\n * \"Deferred-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - The current event plugin system will traverse the list of injected plugins,\n *   in order, and extract events by collecting the plugin's return value of\n *   `extractEvents()`.\n * - These events that are returned from `extractEvents` are \"deferred\n *   dispatched events\".\n * - When returned from `extractEvents`, deferred-dispatched events contain an\n *   \"accumulation\" of deferred dispatches.\n * - These deferred dispatches are accumulated/collected before they are\n *   returned, but processed at a later time by the `EventPluginRegistry` (hence the\n *   name deferred).\n *\n * In the process of returning their deferred-dispatched events, event plugins\n * themselves can dispatch events on-demand without returning them from\n * `extractEvents`. Plugins might want to do this, so that they can use event\n * dispatching as a tool that helps them decide which events should be extracted\n * in the first place.\n *\n * \"On-Demand-Dispatched Events\":\n *\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are not returned from `extractEvents`.\n * - On-demand-dispatched events are dispatched during the process of returning\n *   the deferred-dispatched events.\n * - They should not have side effects.\n * - They should be avoided, and/or eventually be replaced with another\n *   abstraction that allows event plugins to perform multiple \"rounds\" of event\n *   extraction.\n *\n * Therefore, the sequence of event dispatches becomes:\n *\n * - `R`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `R` on-demand)\n * - `S`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `S` on-demand)\n * - `C`s on-demand events (if any)   (dispatched by `C` on-demand)\n * - `R`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginRegistry`)\n * - `S`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginRegistry`)\n * - `C`s extracted events (if any)   (dispatched by `EventPluginRegistry`)\n *\n * In the case of `ResponderEventPlugin`: If the `startShouldSetResponder`\n * on-demand dispatch returns `true` (and some other details are satisfied) the\n * `onResponderGrant` deferred dispatched event is returned from\n * `extractEvents`. The sequence of dispatch executions in this case\n * will appear as follows:\n *\n * - `startShouldSetResponder` (`ResponderEventPlugin` dispatches on-demand)\n * - `touchStartCapture`       (`EventPluginRegistry` dispatches as usual)\n * - `touchStart`              (`EventPluginRegistry` dispatches as usual)\n * - `responderGrant/Reject`   (`EventPluginRegistry` dispatches as usual)\n */\n\nfunction setResponderAndExtractTransfer(topLevelType, targetInst, nativeEvent, nativeEventTarget) {\n  var shouldSetEventType = isStartish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.startShouldSetResponder : isMoveish(topLevelType) ? eventTypes.moveShouldSetResponder : topLevelType === TOP_SELECTION_CHANGE ? eventTypes.selectionChangeShouldSetResponder : eventTypes.scrollShouldSetResponder; // TODO: stop one short of the current responder.\n\n  var bubbleShouldSetFrom = !responderInst ? targetInst : getLowestCommonAncestor(responderInst, targetInst); // When capturing/bubbling the \"shouldSet\" event, we want to skip the target\n  // (deepest ID) if it happens to be the current responder.

It analyzes\n * the geometry of elements, and observes when another responder (scroll view\n * etc) has stolen the touch lock. It notifies your component when it should\n * give feedback to the user. (bouncing/highlighting/unhighlighting).\n *\n * - When a touch was activated (typically you highlight)\n * - When a touch was deactivated (typically you unhighlight)\n * - When a touch was \"pressed\" - a touch ended while still within the geometry\n *   of the element, and no other element (like scroller) has \"stolen\" touch\n *   lock (\"responder\") (Typically you bounce the element).\n *\n * A good tap interaction isn't as simple as you might think. There should be a\n * slight delay before showing a highlight when starting a touch. If a\n * subsequent touch move exceeds the boundary of the element, it should\n * unhighlight, but if that same touch is brought back within the boundary, it\n * should rehighlight again. A touch can move in and out of that boundary\n * several times, each time toggling highlighting, but a \"press\" is only\n * triggered if that touch ends while within the element's boundary and no\n * scroller (or anything else) has stolen the lock on touches.\n *\n * To create a new type of component that handles interaction using the\n * `Touchable` mixin, do the following:\n *\n * - Initialize the `Touchable` state.\n *\n *   getInitialState: function() {\n *     return merge(this.touchableGetInitialState(), yourComponentState);\n *   }\n *\n * - Choose the rendered component who's touches should start the interactive\n *   sequence. On that rendered node, forward all `Touchable` responder\n *   handlers. You can choose any rendered node you like. Choose a node whose\n *   hit target you'd like to instigate the interaction sequence:\n *\n *   // In render function:\n *   return (\n *     <View\n *       onStartShouldSetResponder={this.touchableHandleStartShouldSetResponder}\n *       onResponderTerminationRequest={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminationRequest}\n *       onResponderGrant={this.touchableHandleResponderGrant}\n *       onResponderMove={this.touchableHandleResponderMove}\n *       onResponderRelease={this.touchableHandleResponderRelease}\n *       onResponderTerminate={this.touchableHandleResponderTerminate}>\n *       <View>\n *         Even though the hit detection/interactions are triggered by the\n *         wrapping (typically larger) node, we usually end up implementing\n *         custom logic that highlights this inner one.\n *       </View>\n *     </View>\n *   );\n *\n * - You may set up your own handlers for each of these events, so long as you\n *   also invoke the `touchable*` handlers inside of your custom handler.\n *\n * - Implement the handlers on your component class in order to provide\n *   feedback to the user. See documentation for each of these class methods\n *   that you should implement.\n *\n *   touchableHandlePress: function() {\n *      this.performBounceAnimation();  // or whatever you want to do.\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressIn: function() {\n *     this.beginHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey activation\n *   },\n *   touchableHandleActivePressOut: function() {\n *     this.endHighlighting(...);  // Whatever you like to convey deactivation\n *   },\n *\n * - There are more advanced methods you can implement (see documentation below):\n *   touchableGetHighlightDelayMS: function() {\n *     return 20;\n *   }\n *   // In practice, *always* use a predeclared constant (conserve memory).\n *   touchableGetPressRectOffset: function() {\n *     return {top: 20, left: 20, right: 20, bottom: 100};\n *   }\n */\n\n/**\n * Touchable states.\n */\n\n\nvar States = {\n  NOT_RESPONDER: 'NOT_RESPONDER',\n  // Not the responder\n

Be aware that this can affect layout.\n *\n * Example:\n *\n * ```\n * renderButton: function() {\n *   return (\n *     <TouchableOpacity onPress={this._onPressButton}>\n *       <Image\n *         style={styles.button}\n *         source={require('./myButton.png')}\n *       />\n *     </TouchableOpacity>\n *   );\n * },\n * ```\n * ### Example\n *\n * ```ReactNativeWebPlayer\n * import React, { Component } from 'react'\n * import {\n *   AppRegistry,\n *   StyleSheet,\n *   TouchableOpacity,\n *   Text,\n *   View,\n * } from 'react-native'\n *\n * class App extends Component {\n *   constructor(props) {\n *     super(props)\n *     this.state = { count: 0 }\n *   }\n *\n *   onPress = () => {\n *     this.setState({\n *       count: this.state.count+1\n *     })\n *   }\n *\n *  render() {\n *    return (\n *      <View style={styles.container}>\n *        <TouchableOpacity\n *          style={styles.button}\n *          onPress={this.onPress}\n *        >\n *          <Text> Touch Here </Text>\n *        </TouchableOpacity>\n *        <View style={[styles.countContainer]}>\n *          <Text style={[styles.countText]}>\n *             { this.state.count !== 0 ? this.state.count: null}\n *           </Text>\n *         </View>\n *       </View>\n *     )\n *   }\n * }\n *\n * const styles = StyleSheet.create({\n *   container: {\n *     flex: 1,\n *     justifyContent: 'center',\n *     paddingHorizontal: 10\n *   },\n *   button: {\n *     alignItems: 'center',\n *     backgroundColor: '#DDDDDD',\n *     padding: 10\n *   },\n *   countContainer: {\n *     alignItems: 'center',\n *     padding: 10\n *   },\n *   countText: {\n *     color: '#FF00FF'\n *   }\n * })\n *\n * AppRegistry.registerComponent('App', () => App)\n * ```\n *\n */\n// eslint-disable-next-line react/prefer-es6-class\nvar TouchableOpacity = createReactClass({\n  displayName: 'TouchableOpacity',\n  mixins: [Touchable.Mixin.withoutDefaultFocusAndBlur],\n  getDefaultProps: function getDefaultProps() {\n    return {\n      activeOpacity: 0.2\n    };\n  },\n  getInitialState: function getInitialState() {\n    return _objectSpread({}, this.touchableGetInitialState(), {\n      anim: this._getChildStyleOpacityWithDefault()\n    });\n  },\n  componentDidMount: function componentDidMount() {\n    ensurePositiveDelayProps(this.props);\n  },\n  UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps: function UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {\n    ensurePositiveDelayProps(nextProps);\n  },\n  componentDidUpdate: function componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {\n    if (this.props.disabled !== prevProps.disabled) {\n      this._opacityInactive(250);\n    }\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * Animate the touchable to a new opacity.\n   */\n  setOpacityTo: function setOpacityTo(value, duration) {\n    this.setNativeProps({\n      style: {\n        opacity: value,\n        transitionDuration: duration ? duration / 1000 + \"s\" : '0s'\n      }\n    });\n  },\n\n  /**\n   * `Touchable.Mixin` self callbacks.

The only way\n * to tell is if the `touchStart` occurred immediately after the\n * `onMomentumScrollEnd`.\n *\n * This is abstracted out for you, so you can just call this.scrollResponderIsAnimating() if\n * necessary\n *\n * `ScrollResponder` also includes logic for blurring a currently focused input\n * if one is focused while scrolling.

Otherwise, you would always wonder\n * if the scroll responder is currently in a state where it recognizes new\n * keyboard positions etc. If coordinating scrolling with keyboard movement,\n * *always* use these hooks instead of listening to your own global keyboard\n * events.\n *\n * Public keyboard lifecycle API: (props callbacks)\n *\n * Standard Keyboard Appearance Sequence:\n *\n *   this.props.onKeyboardWillShow\n *   this.props.onKeyboardDidShow\n *\n * `onScrollResponderKeyboardDismissed` will be invoked if an appropriate\n * tap inside the scroll responder's scrollable region was responsible\n * for the dismissal of the keyboard.

Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content. This is a tradeoff that can be adjusted to suit the needs of each application,\n *   and we are working on improving it behind the scenes.\n * - By default, the list looks for a `key` prop on each item and uses that for the React key.\n *   Alternatively, you can provide a custom `keyExtractor` prop.\n *\n * Also inherits [ScrollView Props](docs/scrollview.html#props), unless it is nested in another FlatList of same orientation.\n */\nvar FlatList =\n/*#__PURE__*/\nfunction (_React$PureComponent) {\n  _inheritsLoose(FlatList, _React$PureComponent);\n\n  var _proto = FlatList.prototype;\n\n  /**\n   * Scrolls to the end of the content.

The window adapts to scrolling behavior, and items\n * are rendered incrementally with low-pri (after any running interactions) if they are far from the\n * visible area, or with hi-pri otherwise to minimize the potential of seeing blank space.\n *\n * Some caveats:\n *\n * - Internal state is not preserved when content scrolls out of the render window. Make sure all\n *   your data is captured in the item data or external stores like Flux, Redux, or Relay.\n * - This is a `PureComponent` which means that it will not re-render if `props` remain shallow-\n *   equal. Make sure that everything your `renderItem` function depends on is passed as a prop\n *   (e.g. `extraData`) that is not `===` after updates, otherwise your UI may not update on\n *   changes. This includes the `data` prop and parent component state.\n * - In order to constrain memory and enable smooth scrolling, content is rendered asynchronously\n *   offscreen. This means it's possible to scroll faster than the fill rate ands momentarily see\n *   blank content.
